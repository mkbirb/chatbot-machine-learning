# Chatbot Machine Learning

Machine Learning Project that predicts the Target Capacity and the Target Case Count of Chatbot Systems using Learning Language Based Model System Features as input, where Evaluation Metrics used include Mean Squared Error for Target Capacity, Deviance Error for Target Case Count and R^2 Score. Original Data of the Chatbot was split into three sets which is the Training Set, Validation Set and Testing Set. Furthermore, Linear Regression was used for the Target Capacity Prediction while Poisson Regression was used for the Target Case Count
